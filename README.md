# MERN-TODO-APP
** This is a Todo application built using the MERN stack. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as utilize additional functionality such as marking completed tasks and undoing completed tasks. **

## Getting Started
**To clone the project to your local machine, use the following command:**
“`
git clone https://github.com/username/mern-todo.git
“`

** In the project directory, install the necessary packages with the following command: **
“`npm install`“

** Since the front-end portion of the project is written with React, navigate to the client directory and run the npm install command again before starting the development server with npm start. **
“`
cd client
npm install
npm start
“`

** To start the server portion, run the following command in the root directory: **
“`
npm run server
“`

## Usage
** The MERN Todo application does not require any registration or login. Users can create their tasks using the forms available on the homepage. Tasks will be displayed on the listing page where they can be edited and deleted. Completed tasks can be marked and undone using the respective buttons. **
